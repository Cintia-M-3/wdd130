    <h2> Cintia Rodrigues </h2>
    <p>My name is Cintia Rodrigues, I'm a mother, a wife, a full time employee, now a student and a disciple of Jesus Christ.


        Thanks to Him I'm having this wonderful opportunity to learn new things and explore my potential! Currently I work in 
        a clothing store.
        I am studying Software Development BS. I'm really excited because is totally out of my comfort zone, so I'm going to
        need a lot of faith. 
        I'm from the south of Portugal. I love long walks on the beach, watch sunsets on the cliffs and have nice long dinners 
        with friends and family.
        I got to know the church when I was 21 years old, and I had never heard about the gospel of Jesus Christ or that God even 
        existed. Thanks to the missionaries that invited me to read the Book of Mormon every day, I was able to know that God existed 
        and that His Son Jesus Christ gave His life for us. I eventually got baptized and served a mission in Spain. Now I'm 29 years 
        old, have a baby and a temple marriage. I'm forever grateful to the Book of Mormon and the testimony that it gave me of Jesus Christ.</p>
